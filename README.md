Software Engineering Project Implementation

CREATE YOUR OWN BRANCH TO WORK ON
DO NOT WORK ON THE MASTER

I'm currently aiming to finish creating the different screens needed this weekend
After that just the extra design elements and the back end will be left
Adding the Google API will be a challenge because I've not added it to a Java Project before
